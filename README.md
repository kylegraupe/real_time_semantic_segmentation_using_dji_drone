## Context 

In various industries and applications, there is a growing need for real-time, high-quality video streaming capabilities. DJI is the market-dominant supplier in consumer and industry drones. Therefore, building an application for real-time Computer Vision, leveraging DJI drones like the Mini 4 Pro, is essential to harness the full potential of these advanced imaging systems. This application provides immediate AI analysis to both consumers and professionals, eliminating the need for more costly alternatives and the necessity of DJI SDK while offering comparable control over the video feed and frames.

## Features

- **Real-Time Semantic Segmentation**: Perform live semantic segmentation on drone footage.
- **Custom Model Integration**: Integrate custom U-Net models for segmentation tasks.
- **Post-Processing**: Apply advanced post-processing techniques to improve segmentation accuracy.
- **GUI Integration**: A user-friendly graphical interface for controlling and visualizing the segmentation process.


## SETUP (MacOS Apple Silicon):
- install NGINX with RTMP module: 'brew install nginx-full --with-rtmp'
- configure NGINX Configuration: 'sudo nano /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf'
- set RTMP URL in settings.py file: 'RTMP_URL = "rtmp://your_ip_address:1935/live"'
  - Uses Port 1935, which is the default port, but can be changed in settings.py file.
- install OpenCV with FFMPEG Support (in IDE Terminal):
  - run: 'brew install ffmpeg'
  - run: 'brew install cmake git'
  - run: 'git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git'
  - run: 'cd opencv'
  - run: 'mkdir opencv_build'
  - run: 'cd opencv_build'
  - run: 'cmake -DWITH_FFMPEG=ON -DFFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/include/ffmpeg -DFFMPEG_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libavcodec.dylib ..'
  - run: 'make -j4'
  - run: 'sudo make install'
  - verify installation with 'print(cv2.getBuildInformation())' and check FFMPEG section.

## DEBUGGING:
 - run: 'ffplay -f flv **_your_rtmp_url_**' to verify if stream is being sent via RTMP Server. 
 - run: 'sudo nano /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' to edit nginx.conf file.
   - nginx.conf file controls the functionality of the NGINX Server. There should be a block for the RTMP Server, which will specify the location of the Listening Port (typically 1935).

## EXECUTION:
- open: Local RTMP Server application. This will facilitate the connection from the drone.
- navigate to transmission tab on DJI RC2. select 'Live Streaming Platforms' and select 'RTMP'.
  - currently working with high FPS and low latency on the following settings:
    - Frequency: 2.4 GHz
    - Channel Mode: Auto
    - Resolution: 720p (only option)
    - Bit Rate: 5 Mbps
